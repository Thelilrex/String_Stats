Disclaimer: 
Sometimes your system/compiler might warn you for using the program. 
This is due to lack of signature, which is used to indicate that the program 
has not been tampered. Since, we are rookies, students, and are directly delivering the product
you can trust files and proceed. 

Purpose:
This code is programmed to take user's input and displays:
number of characters (excluding spaces), 
number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and 
number of digits,
in the given input.

How to use the code: 
Open your configured compiler, build the function and run the folder containing main (TestUnitAssignment.java).
User (You): Ideally a computer enthusiast with at least minimal knowledge on configuring, compiling and running code.
Input Device: Active working keyboard (physical or virtual) (Standard input)
Output Device: Screen
Valid Input: English alphabets, numbers, special characters (`"';:!@#$%^&*()_+.\/=,><[]{}-|?)

NOTE: 
Program might work with non english characters, 
however due to the design of the program using other language alphabets would,
result in their characters being considered characters despite them being 
digits or vowel types.

NOTE: Upon pressing "Enter" button the program revokes input permission. There for use "Enter" button to run your input.

Example: 
User's Input: 1a 2e 3i 4o 5u
Output:  
The character count is: 10
The vowels count is: 5
The digit count is: 5

User's Input: Five + Six = ?
Output: 
The character count is: 10
The vowels count is: 3
The digit count is: 0

User's Input: 123 + 6 = ?
Output: 
The character count is: 7
The vowels count is: 0
The digit count is: 4

User's Input: 
Output: Its an empty string

System Requirements:
Any system that has and can compile Java files, preferably a laptop with windows 10 or later OS.

Versions:
Device [Preferred and tested on]: Windows 11 OS [Shouldn't really matter as long as the device has JVM, compiler for java and matching/supporting env with the file]
Language: Java, Version: 20.0.1.0
Download Link: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk20-archive-downloads.html
IDE: Apache NetBeans IDE: Version 17
Download Link: https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/nb17/
Automation tool/Testing tool: Maven:3.8.7
Libraries used: 
    Program: java.util.Scanner;
    Testing: org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
             static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

User Instruction:
If not installed download and install the compiler (Ideally NetBeans) and java(jvm) from the above links

Disclaimer: 
Sometimes your system/compiler might warn you for using the program. 
This is due to lack of signature, which is used to indicate that the program 
has not been tampered. Since, we are rookies, students, and are directly delivering the product
you can trust files and proceed. 

Purpose:
This code is programmed to take user's input and displays:
number of characters (or elements) (excluding spaces), 
number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U) and 
number of digits,
in the given input.

How to use the code:
First download or clone from GitHub to your local storage. 
[path:- TestUnit_Assignment\src\main\java\TestUnitAssignment.java] (You just need to load/open the TestUnit_Assignment from/in your compiler)
Open the project file in your configured compiler, build the function and run 
(that little green play button somewhere on the top) the folder containing main (TestUnitAssignment.java).
User (You): Ideally a computer enthusiast with at least minimal knowledge on configuring, compiling and running code.
Input Device: Active working keyboard (physical or virtual) (Standard input)
Output Device: Screen
Valid Input: English alphabets, numbers, special characters (`"';:!@#$%^&*()_+.\/=,><[]{}-|?)
When and where to input:
Upon running the program the will open command line (a black screen at the bottom or on top of your screen,
You just need to enter your input once you see 
Enter your desired string)

NOTE: 
Program might work with non english characters, 
however due to the design of the program using other language alphabets would,
result in their characters being considered characters despite them being 
digits or vowel types.

Expected Behavior: 
As mentioned earlier the program is supposed to take users input and display characters, vowels and digits.
Upon pressing enter the program will compile and will give your output followed by exit code. 
This program is programmed to run once. If you want to reuse it you need to rerun the main.

NOTE: Upon pressing "Enter" button the program revokes input permission. There for use "Enter" button to run your input.

Example: 
User's Input: 1a 2e 3i 4o 5u
Output:  
The character count is: 10
The vowels count is: 5
The digit count is: 5

User's Input: Five + Six = ?
Output: 
The character count is: 10
The vowels count is: 3
The digit count is: 0

User's Input: 123 + 6 = ?
Output: 
The character count is: 7
The vowels count is: 0
The digit count is: 4

User's Input: 
Output: 0

Testing Instructions:
See the TestUnit_AssignmentTest.java file for the test cases.

Total test cases 19 (pass % = 100)
Test cases that have been tested:

Empty string on char_Count, vowel_Count, and digit_Count methods
Null input on char_Count, vowel_Count, and digit_Count methods
String with only spaces on char_Count, vowel_Count, and digit_Count methods
String with foreign characters on char_Count, vowel_Count, and digit_Count methods
String with special characters on char_Count, vowel_Count, and digit_Count methods
String with alphaNumerical characters on char_Count, vowel_Count, and digit_Count methods
String with capital and small vowels on vowel_count.

Problems:
Due to java's interpretation testing for key characters such as '\n', '\0' etc., we not performed. 
Also if the user inputs "null" the program would consider it as input string with 'n', 'u', 'l', 'l' as its characters. 
Used maven tool for testing. Versions have been mentioned above.
Haven't checked many foreign inputs.
Haven't checked the mixed char and space inputs.
Haven't checked main function
Haven't checked for keywords
Haven't checked for 

NOTE:
Using spacial characters in naming methods leads to test failure. Instead of a_Method use camel notation like aMethod. 
Also, using fail(message) leads to test failure.

NOTE:
Make sure your env configurations match the programs configurations to avoid unexpected behavior and errors
